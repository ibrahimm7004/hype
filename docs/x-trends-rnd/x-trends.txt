top marketing tweets (historically):
searching for specific industries/terms: nothing [top-tweets folder]
big accounts (mostly celebs or big tech) [top-tweets-celebs folder]

common marketing strategies on X:
partnerships with celebs, sports teams,
memes (just text and image as well)
engaging tweets: usually just text or a poll (e.g. questions, CTA, etc) and then engaging with your audience in comments etc
serious ads (images usually)

conclusion: 
you can conduct consistent mid-level marketing on X by using the "common marketing strategies".
Huge dependency on humour, even by big companies, to stay relevant and get *consistent* engagement.

* NOTE: no common hashtags used, not even any consistency in usage by ANY big account (randomly used sometimes, 
and very random hashtags that are specific to the brand)

* NOTE: top regularly trending things (that actually generate a lot of engagement on a daily basis):
- politics/news
- sports
- tech
(And this is why we cannot rely on these- too unrelated to marketing)
